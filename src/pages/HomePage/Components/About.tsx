            I'll be the first to say that web development is truly daunting.
            Developing a product that would meet the intricate needs of
            different users is quite the challenge. But this is what I do and I
            enjoy it. The perfect product might not exist, but be rest assured
            that I will get you something extremely close to perfection.{" "}
            <span>Hi, I am Oghenetega, a fullstack developer.</span> With years
            of experience in architecture and design from school and work, I
            have mastered the skills of understanding client requirements as
            well as users' pain points.

            I've spent the last few years working across different technologies
            in Frontend and Backend such as react, nextJs, typescript, sass,
            redux, etc. I have also worked on various projects with different
            team sizes and this has enhanced my communication skills as well as
            my teamwork. With me, you would be getting a team mate willing to
            learn and grow with the team as well as a consistent pair of hands
            willing to see the project to completion.

            I really believe mindfulness in the workplace is key to successâ€”a
            tenet I live out through my interests in football, chess,
            table-tennis, and basketball. I also love puzzles and anything that
            has to do with history and science. I am currently working as a
            freelance web developer and I am always interested in a challenge.
